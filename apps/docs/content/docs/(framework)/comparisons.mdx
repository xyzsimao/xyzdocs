## Nextra

xyzdocs is highly inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in xyzdocs.

Nextra is more opinionated than xyzdocs, as a side effect, you have to
configure things manually compared to simply editing a configuration file.

xyzdocs works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

### Additional Features

Features supported via 3rd party libraries like [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) will not be listed here.

| Feature                    | xyzdocs | Nextra |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| OpenAPI Integration        | Yes      | No     |

## Mintlify

Mintlify is a documentation service, as compared to xyzdocs, it offers a free tier but isn't completely free and open source.

xyzdocs is not as powerful as Mintlify, for example, the OpenAPI integration of Mintlify.
As the creator of xyzdocs, I wouldn't recommend switching to xyzdocs from Mintlify if you're satisfied with the current way you build docs.
However, I believe xyzdocs is a suitable tool for all React.js developers who want to have elegant docs.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a powerful framework based on React.js. It offers many cool
features with plugins and custom themes.

### Lower Complexity

As xyzdocs is designed to integrate with React frameworks, you may need more knowledge of React.js to get started.
In return, xyzdocs have better customizability.

For a simple docs, Docusaurus might be a better choice if you don't need any framework-specific functionality.

### Plugins

You can easily achieve many things with plugins, their ecosystem is indeed larger and maintained by many contributors.

In comparison, the flexibility of xyzdocs allows you to implement them on your own, it may take longer to tune it to your satisfaction.
